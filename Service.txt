You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. 
But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. 
Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.

Approach:

Service specification targets all pods with label which the pod's specification doesn't have.

We need to update pod's metadata so it will match selector from service spec:

    metadata:
       name: kubectl-test
       app: kubectl-test-12345
Also the service accept connections on port 8000 and then forward it to port 8000 (targetPort) on pod. But pod listen on port 8080 (containerPort). 
So one of them should be changed to match another - targetPort or containerPort.

Also we need to map the Endpoints to make it work.
