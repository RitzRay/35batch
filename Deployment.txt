Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. 
Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.

Steps:

We can configure the pod with a grace period (for example 30 seconds or more, depending on container startup time and image size) 
and set "imagePullPolicy: "Always" and use kubectl delete pod pod_name. A new container will be created and the latest image automatically downloaded, 
then the old container terminated.

kubectl set image deployment/my-deployment mycontainer=<image-name>

It will actually be triggering the rolling-update and that ensures we have the zero downtime.
